Description: Implementation of two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis based
    on the Fourier-transformation approach described by Isao Noda (I. Noda,
    Appl. Spectrosc., 1993, 47, 1329-1336; DOI: 10.1366/0003702934067694). 
    Additionally there are two plot functions for the resulting correlation
    matrix: The first one creates coloured 2D plots, while the second one
    generates 3D plots.
