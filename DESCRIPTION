Description: Implementation of two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis based
    on the Fourier-transformation approach described by Isao Noda (I. Noda
    (1993) <DOI:10.1366/0003702934067694>). Additionally there are two plot
    functions for the resulting correlation matrix: The first one creates
    colored 2D plots, while the second one generates 3D plots.
